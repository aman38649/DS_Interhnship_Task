# Data Science Internship Task

Welcome to our Data Science Internship Task!

## Task Description

In this internship, you will be required to:

1. Read and parse JSON files containing algorithm parameters and configurations.
2. Preprocess the provided datasets, including feature handling and reduction.
3. Implement various machine learning algorithms based on the specified prediction type (regression or classification).
4. Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
5. Evaluate and log standard model metrics for each best-performing model.

## Dataset

For this task, you will be using the "Iris" dataset containing features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species. The dataset is provided in the "iris_dataset.csv" file.

## JSON Configuration

You will be provided with a JSON file named "algoparams_from_ui.json," which will contain algorithm parameters, feature handling options, feature reduction methods, and hyperparameter grids for each model.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/aman38649/DS_Internship_Task.git`.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (Pandas, Scikit-learn).
3. Place the "iris_dataset.csv" and "algoparams_from_ui.json" files in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Run the Python script "ml_pipeline.py" to perform the Data Science Internship task.
5. Review the results and log information to gain insights into model performance.
